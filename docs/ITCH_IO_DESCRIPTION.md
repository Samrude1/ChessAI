# Yes Man Chess Terminal

**Play chess against Fallout: New Vegas's Yes Man in a retro-futuristic terminal!**

This web game features a custom interface inspired by the RobCo terminals from the Fallout universe, complete with CRT monitor effects, scanlines, and the overly optimistic personality of everyone's favorite Securitron.

## 🎮 Features

- **Opponent**: Play against a chess engine tailored to your skill level (Warning: He's excessively helpful!)
- **Personality**: Yes Man reacts to the game state with different moods and facial expressions (from confident smirk to desperate panic!)
- **Visuals**: Authentic retro terminal aesthetic with scanlines, curvature, and glow effects.
- **Customization**: Change the terminal color to any hue using the Start Menu slider.
